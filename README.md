Backend server with Spring and kotlin

## A simple backend server with Spring Boot, Kotlin and PostegreSQL.
This is still very much a work in progress. The goal is to learn Spring and Kotlin development for backend. 

Main objective is to have a basic CRUD functionality working witk PostgreSQL database.
This is going to be the backend server for my personal photography portfolio website (frontend is also TBD).
